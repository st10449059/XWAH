# Purpose of my application 
The purpose of my application is to empower gardeners and domestic workers by enhancing their knowledge and skills through accessible education. Both the app and the website feature a diverse selection of seven courses designed to cater to various learning needs and schedules. Among these, three are intensive six-week courses that focus on specific topics, providing participants with in-depth knowledge and practical skills in a short time frame. The remaining four courses span six months, allowing for a more comprehensive exploration of subjects such as sustainable gardening practices, advanced horticultural techniques, and effective household management strategies. Each course is crafted by industry experts and includes interactive content, videos, and resources to ensure an engaging learning experience. By offering flexible learning options, we aim to equip users with the tools they need to excel in their roles, ultimately fostering personal growth and improving their career prospects in the gardening and domestic work sectors.
# Design considerations
The home page of our platform provides a clear and inviting introduction to the business, featuring a concise description of our mission and offerings alongside a prominent display of our logo. This establishes a strong brand identity and sets the tone for the user experience. 
The course page presents a comprehensive summary of all available courses, allowing users to easily browse their options. Each course is accompanied by a “Learn More” button, which directs users to detailed information, including curriculum highlights, duration, and enrollment requirements. Engaging visuals are incorporated to provide a captivating representation of each course, enhancing user interest and understanding.
Additionally, our contact page is designed for easy access, listing essential details such as our email, phone number, and the locations of each venue where users can attend their courses. This ensures that users can reach out with questions or visit us in person.
The cart page streamlines the purchasing process by displaying each selected course alongside its price. Notably, users benefit from a discount when they add two or more courses to their cart, encouraging broader engagement with our educational offerings. Overall, these features work together to create a user-friendly and informative experience that promotes learning and connection.
# utilisation of github and github actions
To make sure my code works on more platforms than just my local machine, I'll be using GitHub Actions to expedite the testing process. Through the use of GitHub Actions, I want to confirm that the program runs without a hitch on my PC as well as a variety of other computers, including mobile devices. Furthermore, GitHub is a great resource for preserving the application's dependability and guaranteeing a positive user experience. It fosters continuous improvement by offering a collaborative area where problems can be recorded, defects can be reported, and upgrades can be offered. Furthermore, GitHub will be essential in providing thorough reports that outline the application's goals and features. These reports will elucidate the application's objectives, features, and implementation procedures, thereby facilitating a comprehensive understanding for both developers and end-users alike. Through GitHub's robust capabilities, I aim to enhance the reliability, usability, and transparency of the application, ultimately enriching the overall development and user experience.
